# Welcome to My Alien-loving World!

![Alien](public/ufo.gif)

Hey there! I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for all things extraterrestrial. ðŸ‘½ I dabble in JavaScript, PHP, and Flutter, but my curiosity knows no bounds. I'm constantly exploring new technologies and languages, and currently, I'm lusting to know Rust and Golang. ðŸš€

In this repository, you'll find a collection of my projects, experiments, and musings. Feel free to explore and join me on this intergalactic coding journey!
